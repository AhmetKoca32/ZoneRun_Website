      <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>The ZoneRun app may collect or process the following types of data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Location data:</strong> Location permission (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) is used for run and area tracking, and for drawing routes and polygons on the map. This data is used for map display and statistics.</li>
        <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Firebase Authentication is used for optional sign-in. Email address and name (if provided by the user) are processed for account management.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and app information:</strong> If Firebase Analytics is used, this may include device type and app usage information.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification preferences:</strong> Preferences and timing for scheduled notifications are stored only on your device and are not sent to our servers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Purpose of Use</h2>
      <p>Collected data is used for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculating and displaying run and area statistics on the map</li>
        <li>Account creation, sign-in, and account management</li>
        <li>Improving the app experience (when analytics is used)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Storage and Sharing</h2>
      <p>Your data may be processed and stored on servers using Firebase (Google) infrastructure. Your data is not sold to third parties. We do not share your data with third parties except where required by law (e.g. court order or lawful request by authorities).</p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Data is transmitted over HTTPS. Firebase applies its own security measures. We aim to ensure that sensitive information is transmitted and stored securely.</p>
